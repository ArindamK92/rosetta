3rd Party Benchmark Suites
==========================
Integration of pre-existing benchmark collections into the Rostetta PPM framework. The goal is comparability and easy compilation without going through custom build tools for each suite.
The external benchmark suites may not have variants available in all PPMs, in which case we attempt a manual translation.
